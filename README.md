# Image Captioning Project

This repository contains a project for generating captions for images using deep learning models. The project involves preprocessing image data, training a model, and generating captions for new images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which includes images and their corresponding captions.
## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- tqdm
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow tqdm matplotlib seaborn

## Usage
#### 1. Clone the Repository
code:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Captioning.git
cd Image-Captioning
#### 2. Prepare the Data
Ensure the COCO dataset is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory. You can modify the data paths in the notebook as needed.

#### 3. Run the Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially to train the model and generate image captions.

## Key Sections in the Notebook
#### Data Preparation:
- Loading the dataset
- Preprocessing images and captions
#### Model Building:
- Defining the CNN-RNN model architecture
#### Training:
- Training the model with the COCO dataset
#### Evaluation:
- Generating captions for new images

## Results:

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance by generating captions for new images. The model's performance can be visualized using various evaluation metrics and plots.

## Example:

Here's an example of a generated caption:
